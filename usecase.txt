Q1. Art forgery - explain the problem and mention current solutions.

Art forgery is the act of creating false work of art which is credited to some
famous artists. This is very lucrative crime, however new analysis techniques 
make the forgery more complicated.

There is number of examination techniques used to find out the forgery:
- analysis of art creation methods and tools
- materials and colors used to create the art
- signatures analysis
- forensic authentication (carbon dating, white lead dating, x-ray examination,
  spectrophotometry etc)
- digital authentication (statistical analysis)

Q2. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of using a blockchain solution.

Blockchain solution can be used to create leadger of art certifications,
to prove authenticity of particular art work and keep history of buy/sell
transactions.

The advantage will be to control art market through proven digital solution,
improving provenance and reducing art forgery.

The disadvantage will be that it will work great for digital art, but other
art artifacts (paintings, sculptures etc) will need to first obtain some
kind of digital signature to enter the blockchain network and this will open
some new possibility for the forgery.

Q3. Design a network to help the art market. 
    Think about Peers, CA, Channels and Smart Contracts. 
    Make a critical analysis.
