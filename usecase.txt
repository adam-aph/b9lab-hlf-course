Q1. Art forgery - explain the problem and mention current solutions.

Art forgery is the act of creating false work of art which is credited to some
famous artists. This is very lucrative crime, however new analysis techniques 
make the forgery more complicated.

There is number of examination techniques used to find out the forgery:
- analysis of art creation methods and tools
- materials and colors used to create the art
- signatures analysis
- forensic authentication (carbon dating, white lead dating, x-ray examination,
  spectrophotometry etc)
- digital authentication (statistical analysis)

Q2. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of using a blockchain solution.

Blockchain solution can be used to create leadger of art certifications,
to prove authenticity of particular art work and keep history of buy/sell
transactions.

The advantage will be to control art market through proven digital solution,
improving provenance and reducing art forgery.

The disadvantage will be that it will work great for digital art, but other
art artifacts (paintings, sculptures etc) will need to first obtain some
kind of digital signature to enter the blockchain network and this will open
some new possibility for the forgery.

Q3. Design a network to help the art market. Think about Peers, CA, Channels
    and Smart Contracts. Make a critical analysis.
    
The art market network can be designed in following way:
- set of art dealers {ArtDealer1, ArtDealer2} which are 
  connected to ArtMarket
- each art dealer is able to "createArt"
- the member of ArtMarket can "buyArt" or "sellArt"

Permissions:
- only members of {ArtDealer1, ArtDealer2} can "createArt"
- only members of ArtMarket can "buyArt" or "sellArt"
- only the participants which are involved in an exchange transaction 
  should be able to see it
  
Peers of art dealers will represent artists, peers of ArtMarket will represent
art collectors. The transactions of every dealer are protected by dedicated
channel between dealer and ArtMarket. The chaincode will define operations to
"createArt", "buyArt" and "sellArt". The access control in chaincode will
verify that only client of art dealer can "createArt" and clients of ArtMarket
can "buyArt" or "sellArt". Fabric CA will be used to authenticate all
clients.
