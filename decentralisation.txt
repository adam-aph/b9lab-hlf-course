If you want to run the network on multiple hosts, you have a few options:

Q1. You could run the nodes native on hosts. Why is this impractical?

In that case all the network setup (IP translations, ports etc) would need
to be maintained manually. This is very error prone in case of multiple
nodes.

Q2. You could use various services, e.g. Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. 
    Explain briefly Swarm and Kubernetes. Name some sources for the next steps
    to use them for Hyperledger Fabric.
    
Both Swarm and Kubernetes allow for cluster management in multi-host environment,
automatic scaling, service discovery, load balancing etc. Both these frameworks
can be configured via Hyperledger Composer tool. Example for Fabric and 
Kubernetes: https://github.com/IBM/blockchain-network-on-kubernetes
    
Q3. You can use IBM Cloud. Tell us what it offers in regard to Hyperledger
    Fabric.
    
It allows to sign up to participate in the IBM Blockchain for Hyperledger 
Fabric v1.0 beta program on IBM Cloud and build, run and manage it live:

Q4. There is a project called Hyperledger Cello. Explain, what it aims to do 
    and where one can learn more about it, as well how to get support.
    
Hyperledger Cello is a framework used to reduce the effort required for creating,
managing and terminating blockchains. It provides a multi-tenant chain service 
efficiently and automatically on top of various infrastructures, e.g., baremetal,
virtual machine, and more container platforms.
